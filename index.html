    <h1>Welcom fellow developer!</h1>
    <h2>Tell me how you feel about this class, what are you looking forward to, what are you afraid of?</h2>
    <h3>Jarno</h3>

    <h3>Ladis</h3>
    <p>I'm looking forward to diving deeper into WEB2.0 and WEB3.0. Also, eating donuts doesn't sound too bad honestly. I'm afraid of falling behind since I don't have the foundation most developers already have.</p>
    <h3>Seppe</h3>
    <p>I am looking forward to work a project around donuts. I love to eat donuts! Besides, I want to learn more about websockets and creating
        an own crypto currency or something else with blockchain!
